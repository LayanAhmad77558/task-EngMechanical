# ðŸ¤– 5-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation (TinkerCAD)

This project presents a simple 3D simulation of a robotic arm with 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) designed using TinkerCAD. The design mimics the movement of a real-world robotic arm and can be used for educational or prototyping purposes.

## ðŸ§© Design Description

The robotic arm consists of 5 movable joints, representing 5 degrees of freedom:

| Part             | Description                         | DOF |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| Base             | Rotates the entire arm left/right   | 1   |
| Lower Arm        | Moves the arm up/down (shoulder)    | 2   |
| Elbow Joint      | Bends/extends the arm (elbow)       | 3   |
| Wrist            | Tilts or rotates the wrist section  | 4   |
| Gripper (Claw)   | Opens/closes to grab objects        | 5   |

Each part was modeled using basic TinkerCAD shapes such as boxes and cylinders. The goal was to keep the design simple, lightweight, and educational.
